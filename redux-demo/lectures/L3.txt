Three Principles
First Principle
"The global state of your app is stored as an object inside a single store"
Maintain our app state in a single object which would be managed by the redux store.

Second Principle
"The only way to change the state is to dispatch an action, an object that describes what happened"
To update the state of your app, you need to let Redux know about that with an action.
Not allowed to directly update the state object.

Third Principle
"To specify how the state tree is updated bases on actions, you write pure reducers"
Reducer - (prevState, action) => newState
